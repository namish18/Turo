Problem Statement 4- AI-Driven Personalized Learning Assistant Problem Statement:
 Educational institutions in semi-urban and rural areas face difficulties providing personalized learning. We seek an AI system that adapts to each student’s learning pace, identifies knowledge gaps, and gives real-time feedback accessible via affordable devices. Background: Traditional teaching methods do not fully address diverse student needs in engineering education, especially outside urban centers. Problem: How can we develop a scalable AI platform that personalizes education, integrates with digital classrooms, and functions efficiently on low-cost devices even in low connectivity settings? Desired Outcome: An AI-powered adaptive learning solution that personalizes content and feedback, accessible both online and offline. Impact: Empowers engineering students in underserved regions, enhances academic results, and bridges urban-rural education gaps.
